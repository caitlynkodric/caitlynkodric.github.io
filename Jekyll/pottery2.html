display: Pottery - Wheel Throwing
project: 10 Week Pottery
date: Winter 2018
tools: Wheel, Clay
first_title: Process
descript: This project is from a pottery wheel class that I took during last term. During the course we used technique on the wheel to throw cylinders and make them hollow. With this process we were able to use creative ideas to create anything involving these techniques. I created bowls, a mug, pitchers, and an egg cup. First you must wedge the clay (like kneading), this is used to remove air bubbles. While the clay is on the wheel, you use your hands to pull the clay up to create a hollow cylinder giving pressure accordingly for convex and concave walls.
