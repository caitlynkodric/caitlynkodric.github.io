    <p class="justify">The project was created at BreakInequality Hackathon presented by Devs Without Boarders in Kitchener, ON. 
       In Bangladesh there are many geographic areas with unsustainable health care. 
       The given case study was to build a program or app to connect the health social workers and their pregnant patients in Bangladesh.
       Since women can have many complications, "The focus will be present data in a manner that is understandable for community members with low literacy. 
       Additionally, it can have built-in accountability measures to ensure that data is used for developing action plans and to monitor progress of these plans.".
